# Instructions

This was developed and tested on Python 3.10.5 by Octavio Telles Teichner (ott.html@gmail.com).  
To run, all you need to do is ensure the `api-response.json` file is in the same directory as the `tasks.py` file and run:  
```
python tasks.py
```

Usually, I'd add a lot of unit tests and extract any strings into constants, but the problem statement recommends keeping it simple.
